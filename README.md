# Build Your Personal Chief of Staff

**A step-by-step guide to creating an AI-powered strategic thinking partner**

---

## What Is This?

This is a complete tutorial for building a Personal Chief of Staff using Claude AI.

**Not a task manager. Not a productivity app. A strategic thinking partner.**

One that:
- Knows your goals and keeps you focused on what matters
- Challenges your excuses and pushes you toward action
- Asks hard questions that clarify your thinking
- Tracks your commitments and holds you accountable
- Remembers your context across every conversation

---

## The Tutorial

### [Module 0: Introduction](tutorial/00-introduction.md)
**Time:** 10 minutes reading

Why you need a Personal Chief of Staff and what makes this different from traditional productivity systems.

---

### [Module 1: Setup](tutorial/01-setup.md)
**Time:** 15 minutes

Get Claude Pro and create your first Claude Project. Set up your workspace for daily use.

---

### [Module 2: Know Yourself](tutorial/02-know-yourself.md)
**Time:** 1-2 hours

Deep reflection on how you actually work. Create your User Profile documenting your patterns, constraints, and preferences.

**This is the hardest module.** It requires honest self-examination. Don't skip it.

---

### [Module 3: Set Goals](tutorial/03-set-goals.md)
**Time:** 1-2 hours

Define what success looks like. Create specific, measurable goals with deep "why" context and weekly targets.

**Time:** 30 minutes

Program your CoS. Define how it should interact with you, when to push back, and what to focus on.

---

### [Module 5: Daily Practice](tutorial/05-daily-practice.md)
**Time:** 30 minutes to learn, 10-15 min/day ongoing

Learn how to use your CoS effectively. See example check-ins and build the daily habit.

All templates are in the [`tutorial/templates/`](tutorial/templates/) folder:

- **User Profile Template** - Structure for documenting how you work
- **Goals Document Template** - Framework for setting clear, measurable goals
- **Project Instructions Template** - Example Custom Instructions for your CoS

## Cost

**One-time:**
- Your time: 3-5 hours for initial setup

**Ongoing:**
- Claude Pro: $20/month (required for Projects feature)
- Your time: 10-15 minutes/day for check-ins

**Is it worth it?**

Ask yourself: What's the cost of NOT executing on your important goals?

If $20/month helps you actually accomplish what matters, it's likely the highest ROI subscription you'll have.

## FAQ

**Do I really need Claude Pro?**

Yes. The Projects feature (which gives your CoS memory and context) requires Claude Pro. There's no workaround.

**Can I use ChatGPT or another AI instead?**

You could adapt this tutorial, but it's specifically designed for Claude Projects. The structure and features may not translate directly.

**How long until I see results?**

Most people feel clarity within Week 1. Measurable progress on goals typically shows by Week 4. Real transformation happens around Month 3.

**What if I skip check-ins?**

The system only works with consistent use. If you skip check-ins for a week, you've basically paused the system. It can't help if you don't use it.

**Can I share my CoS with others?**

Your CoS is personalized to YOU (your Profile, Goals, etc.). Others should build their own using this tutorial.

**Is this actually just talking to Claude?**

Yes, but with crucial differences:
- It has persistent memory of your goals and context
- It's programmed to act as YOUR strategic partner
- It references your personal documents automatically
- Conversation history builds understanding over time

It's the difference between talking to a stranger and talking to someone who knows you deeply.
