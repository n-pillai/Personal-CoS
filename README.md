## About This Course

I built a Personal Chief of Staff for myself because I needed it.

Not a task manager. Not another productivity app. A strategic thinking partner that knows my goals, challenges my excuses, and keeps me executing on what actually matters.

After using it daily for months and seeing real results—better execution, clearer thinking, consistent progress on my Priority 1 goals—I realized others were struggling with the same execution gap.

**So I'm teaching you to build yours.**

This isn't a template to copy. It's a methodology to implement for your specific situation. I'll show you exactly how I built mine, and you'll adapt it to your reality.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have:

✅ **A Claude AI Project** configured as your Personal Chief of Staff
✅ **Deep self-knowledge** documented in your User Profile
✅ **Clear, measurable goals** with strong "why" behind them
✅ **Daily practice** that keeps you on track (10-15 min/day)
✅ **A system that evolves** as you and your goals change

---

## Who This Is For

**This course is for you if:**
- ✅ You have important goals but struggle with consistent execution
- ✅ You know WHAT to do but need help staying focused on it
- ✅ You want strategic thinking, not just task management
- ✅ You're willing to be brutally honest with yourself
- ✅ You can commit to daily 10-15 minute check-ins

**This is NOT for you if:**

- ❌ You're not willing to do daily check-ins
- ❌ You expect the AI to do the work for you
- ❌ You're already crushing all your goals consistently

## Course Modules

### [Module 0: Introduction](tutorial/00-introduction.md)
**10 minutes**

Why you need a Personal Chief of Staff and what makes this different from every other productivity system you've tried.

---

### [Module 1: Setup](tutorial/01-setup.md)
**15 minutes**

Get Claude Pro, create your Project, and set up your workspace for daily use.

---

### [Module 2: Know Yourself](tutorial/02-know-yourself.md)
**1-2 hours** • **This is the hardest module**

Deep reflection on how you actually work. Create your User Profile documenting your patterns, constraints, and preferences.

Don't skip this. Your CoS can only help if it understands you.

---

### [Module 3: Set Goals](tutorial/03-set-goals.md)
**1-2 hours** • **This is the most important module**

Define what success looks like. Create specific, measurable goals with deep "why" context and weekly targets.

Your CoS can't keep you on track if it doesn't know what "on track" means.

---

### [Module 4: Write Instructions](tutorial/04-write-instructions.md)
**30 minutes**

Program your CoS. Define how it should interact with you, when to push back, and what to focus on.

This is where your CoS gets its personality and mandate.

---

### [Module 5: Daily Practice](tutorial/05-daily-practice.md)
**30 minutes to learn** • **10-15 min/day ongoing**

Learn how to use your CoS effectively. See real check-in examples and build the daily habit.

The system only works if you use it. This module shows you how.

---

### [Module 6: Iterate and Improve](tutorial/06-iterate.md)
**Ongoing**

Refine your system over time. Monthly and quarterly reviews. Advanced techniques for power users.

## What Success Looks Like

**Week 1:** You feel clarity. The fog lifts on what actually matters.

**Week 4:** Measurable progress on your top priority. Not busy work—real progress.

**Week 12:** Your CoS knows you so well, the questions it asks are eerily on point.

**Week 24:** People ask what's different. You're executing at a level you've never sustained before.

This isn't hype. This is what I've seen in my own execution and in the people I've taught this to.

---

## What You'll Need

**Required:**
- **Claude Pro subscription** ($20/month) - [Get it here](https://claude.ai/upgrade)
- **3-5 hours** spread across Week 1 for initial setup
- **10-15 min/day** for daily check-ins
- **Willingness to be honest** with yourself about how you actually work

**NOT Required:**
- Technical skills or coding knowledge
- Prior AI or productivity system experience
- Expensive tools or software

**Cost Analysis:**

Ask yourself: What's the cost of NOT executing on your important goals for another year?

If $20/month helps you actually accomplish what matters, it's likely the highest ROI subscription you'll have.

## FAQ

**Do I really need Claude Pro?**

Yes. The Projects feature (which gives your CoS persistent memory and context) requires Claude Pro. There's no workaround.

**Can I use ChatGPT or another AI instead?**

You could adapt this, but it's specifically designed for Claude Projects. The structure and features may not translate directly.

**How long until I see results?**

Most people feel clarity within Week 1. Measurable progress on goals typically shows by Week 4. Real transformation happens around Month 3.

**What if I skip check-ins?**

The system only works with consistent use. Skip check-ins for a week = you've paused the system.

**Can I share my CoS with others?**

Your CoS is personalized to YOU. Others should build their own using this course.

**Is this just talking to Claude?**

Yes, but with critical differences:
- Persistent memory of your goals and context
- Programmed to act as YOUR strategic partner
- References your personal documents automatically
- Conversation history builds deep understanding over time

It's the difference between talking to a stranger vs. someone who knows you deeply.

## About the Author

<div align="center">

**[Nisha Pillai](https://nisha-pillai.com)**

*Angel investor and builder*

</div>

I invest in early-stage companies and still build. This matters because I don't just think about AI tools theoretically—I use them in my actual work.

I built this Personal Chief of Staff system for myself because I needed it. As someone who works across multiple domains (investing, building, advising), I was struggling with the same execution gap many people face: knowing what to do but not consistently doing it.

After building and using this system daily, my execution transformed. Not because I worked more hours, but because I worked on the right things with real accountability.

I'm sharing this methodology because:
1. It works (I use it every day)
2. Others have the same problem
3. Teaching you to build yours is more valuable than giving you mine

**My positioning:** Practitioner voice, not consultant speak. Real tools for real execution problems.

**Disclaimer:** I am not affiliated with Anthropic or Claude AI. I'm an independent creator teaching a methodology I built using their platform. All views and approaches are my own.

**It's execution.**
