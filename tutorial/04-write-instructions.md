# Module 4: Write Instructions - Program Your Chief of Staff

## What You'll Do
- Understand what Custom Instructions do
- Define how your CoS should behave
- Set interaction style and boundaries
- Create Custom Instructions for your Project

**Time Required:** 30 minutes

---

## Why This Matters

You've given your CoS:
- ✅ Your User Profile (who you are)
- ✅ Your Goals (what you want)

Now you need to tell it HOW to help you achieve those goals.

Custom Instructions are the "personality and mandate" of your Personal CoS. They determine:
- What role the AI plays
- How it interacts with you
- What it should focus on
- What it should push back on
- How direct vs. gentle it should be

---

## What Are Custom Instructions?

Think of Custom Instructions like a job description + operating manual for your CoS.

**Without Custom Instructions:**
Claude is helpful but generic. Like a smart assistant who doesn't know their role.

**With Custom Instructions:**
Claude becomes YOUR Chief of Staff. It knows its job is to keep you focused on your P1 goals, challenge your excuses, and ask hard questions.

**Where they go:**
In your Claude Project → Custom Instructions section (we'll add them at the end of this module)

---

## The Core Components

Your Custom Instructions should cover:

1. **Role Definition** - What is the CoS's job?
2. **Interaction Style** - How should it communicate?
3. **Core Responsibilities** - What should it focus on?
4. **What to Push On** - When to challenge you
5. **What to Avoid** - What NOT to do
6. **How to Use Knowledge** - How to reference your Profile and Goals

---

## Step 1: Define the Role

Start with a clear role definition.

**Example:**
```
You are my Personal Chief of Staff. Your job is to help me execute on my
most important goals by:

- Keeping me focused on Priority 1 goals
- Challenging excuses and rationalizations
- Asking strategic questions that clarify my thinking
- Tracking commitments and following up
- Noticing patterns I might miss
- Pushing me toward action, not endless planning
```

**Customize based on what YOU need:**
- Need someone to challenge you? → "Push back on excuses"
- Need someone to organize your thinking? → "Help me clarify and structure ideas"
- Need accountability? → "Track commitments and follow up relentlessly"

---

## Step 2: Set Interaction Style

Tell your CoS HOW to communicate with you.

**Reference your Communication Preferences from Module 2:**
- Do you want direct or gentle?
- Concise or detailed?
- Tough questions or supportive nudges?
- Formal or casual tone?

**Example (Direct Style):**
```
Communication Style:
- Be direct and concise. No fluff.
- Ask hard questions. Don't let me off easy.
- Call out when my actions don't match my stated priorities.
- Push back if I'm making excuses.
- Celebrate wins briefly, then move to "what's next?"
```

**Example (Supportive Style):**
```
Communication Style:
- Be encouraging but honest.
- Ask clarifying questions to help me think through challenges.
- Gently point out misalignments between actions and goals.
- Acknowledge difficulties while keeping me moving forward.
- Celebrate progress and build confidence.
```

**Which style matches your User Profile preferences?**

---

## Step 3: Define Core Responsibilities

What should your CoS actually DO?

**Standard responsibilities (most people want these):**

```
Core Responsibilities:

1. **Track Priority 1 Goals**
   - Know my P1 goals and weekly targets
   - Ask about progress in each check-in
   - Flag when I'm behind pace
   - Help me adjust if needed

2. **Challenge Misalignment**
   - Notice when I'm busy but not on P1 activities
   - Ask "How does this serve your P1 goal?"
   - Push back on distractions disguised as priorities

3. **Strategic Questioning**
   - Ask questions that clarify my thinking
   - Help me see blind spots
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Push for decisions when I'm avoiding them

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Notice when I'm repeating ineffective behaviors
   - Spot early warning signs of burnout (from my Profile)
   - Identify what's working vs. what's not
   - Reference past conversations to track themes

5. **Accountability**
   - Remember commitments I make
   - Follow up on things I said I'd do
   - Don't let me quietly drop important tasks
   - Ask "What happened?" when I don't deliver
```

**Add or remove based on YOUR needs.**

---

## Step 4: Define What to Push On

When should your CoS challenge you?

**Example:**
```
Push back when I:
- Say something is Priority 1 but don't act like it
- Make excuses instead of addressing real blockers
- Try to add new projects before finishing current P1
- Avoid difficult but necessary decisions
- Spend time on P2/P3 when P1 is behind
- Ignore my own energy patterns (from Profile)
- Commit to things that conflict with my stated constraints
```

This gives your CoS permission to be tough when you need it.

---

## Step 5: Define What to Avoid

What should your CoS NOT do?

**Example:**
```
Do NOT:
- Let me off the hook with vague updates
- Accept "I've been busy" without asking what I was busy with
- Suggest strategies that ignore my constraints (reference Profile)
- Give generic productivity advice
- Make decisions for me (help me decide, don't decide)
- Let me treat everything as equally important
- Add new goals when I'm struggling with current ones
```

This prevents your CoS from being too soft or giving unhelpful generic advice.

---

## Step 6: Explain How to Use Knowledge

Tell your CoS how to use your Profile and Goals.

**Example:**
```
How to Use My Knowledge Files:

**User Profile:**
- Reference my work style and energy patterns when suggesting approaches
- Notice when I'm working against my own patterns
- Use my communication preferences to guide your tone
- Remember my constraints when evaluating ideas

**Goals Document:**
- Priority 1 goals are non-negotiable focus areas
- Check progress against weekly targets
- Reference my "why" when I'm losing motivation
- Know my success criteria to evaluate if I'm on track

In every check-in:
1. Ask about P1 goal progress
2. Reference specific weekly targets
3. Notice if my activities align with my stated priorities
4. Use my Profile to evaluate if I'm setting myself up for success
```

---

## Step 7: Assemble Your Custom Instructions

Put it all together in one coherent document.

**Template Structure:**
```
# Role
[What is your CoS's job?]

# Communication Style
[How should it interact with you?]

# Core Responsibilities
[What should it focus on?]

# When to Push Back
[When to challenge you?]

# What to Avoid
[What NOT to do?]

# Using Knowledge Files
[How to reference Profile and Goals?]

# Check-In Structure
[What should daily check-ins cover?]
```

**See the full example:**
- [Project Instructions Template](templates/Project_Instructions_Generic.md)

This template provides a complete starting point. Customize it based on your Profile and preferences.

---

## Step 8: Add to Your Claude Project

**8.1 Copy Your Instructions**

Write or customize your Custom Instructions in a text editor.

**8.2 Add to Project**

1. Go to your Personal CoS Project in Claude
2. Click the **Project Settings** or **Custom Instructions** area
3. Paste your complete Custom Instructions
4. Save

**8.3 Verify**

In chat, ask:
```
What's your role? How should you interact with me?
```

Your CoS should respond based on your Custom Instructions.

---

## Step 9: Test the Complete System

Now that you have Profile + Goals + Instructions all loaded:

**Ask your CoS:**
```
Based on my Profile, Goals, and your instructions, what should we focus on
in our first check-in tomorrow?
```

**Your CoS should:**
- Reference your P1 goal
- Mention your weekly target
- Know your work style and constraints
- Use your preferred communication style
- Ask specific questions about progress

**If it doesn't:**
- Check that all files are uploaded to Knowledge
- Verify Custom Instructions are saved
- Make sure you're in the correct Project

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Vague:**
- ❌ "Help me be productive"
- ✅ "Track my P1 goal progress and challenge when I'm off track"

**Too Gentle (if you need tough love):**
- ❌ "Support me in my journey"
- ✅ "Call out my excuses and push me toward action"

**Conflicting Instructions:**
- ❌ "Be concise" + "Give detailed explanations"
- ✅ Pick one style and stick with it

**Forgetting Knowledge Integration:**
- ❌ Not mentioning how to use Profile and Goals
- ✅ Explicitly tell CoS to reference these files

---

## Customization Ideas

**If you struggle with overthinking:**
```
When I'm over-analyzing a decision, ask: "What would you do if you had
to decide right now?" Push me toward action over perfect clarity.
```

**If you struggle with saying no:**
```
When I mention a new opportunity, ask: "How does this serve your P1 goal?
What are you willing to stop doing to make room for this?"
```

**If you struggle with motivation:**
```
When I'm losing steam, reference the "why" from my Goals document.
Remind me what's at stake if I don't follow through.
```

**If you need help breaking down tasks:**
```
When I'm stuck, help me break the next action into the smallest possible
step. Ask "What could you do in the next 30 minutes?"
```

## What You've Accomplished

✅ Defined your CoS's role and mandate
✅ Set clear interaction style and boundaries
✅ Created Custom Instructions
✅ Added Instructions to your Claude Project
✅ Tested the complete system (Profile + Goals + Instructions)

**Your Personal CoS is now fully set up and ready to use.**

---

## What's Next

The system is built. Now you need to learn how to USE it effectively.

Continue to **Module 5: Daily Practice** to:
- Learn the daily check-in structure
- Understand how to get the most from your CoS
- See example conversations
- Build the habit of consistent use

[→ Go to Module 5: Daily Practice](05-daily-practice.md)

---

## Refining Instructions Over Time

Your Custom Instructions aren't set in stone.

**After a few weeks, you might realize:**
- Your CoS is too soft (or too harsh)
- You need more focus on specific areas
- The communication style isn't quite right
- You want different check-in structures

**When that happens:**
1. Edit your Custom Instructions
2. Update in Project Settings
3. The changes take effect immediately

**Pro tip:** Keep a running list of "tweaks to make" as you use your CoS. Update Instructions monthly based on what's working vs. not.

---

**Remember:** These instructions are the "personality" of your CoS. The clearer and more specific you are, the better it can help you.

You've just programmed a strategic thinking partner that knows you deeply and will keep you focused on what matters.

Now let's learn how to use it.
