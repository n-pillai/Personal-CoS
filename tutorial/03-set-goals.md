# Module 3: Set Goals - Define What Success Looks Like

## What You'll Do
- Identify your most important goals
- Make them specific and measurable
- Document WHY they matter (the critical part)
- Create your Goals document for your CoS

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours (don't rush this)

---

## Why This Matters

Your Personal CoS can't keep you on track if it doesn't know what "on track" means.

Most people fail at goals because:
- They're too vague ("get healthier")
- There's no measurement ("make progress")
- They forget WHY it matters
- They try to tackle too many at once

**Your CoS needs clear, measurable goals with deep "why" context.**

---

## The Priority System

You'll organize goals into three tiers:

**Priority 1: The Non-Negotiable**
- Maximum 1-2 goals
- If you accomplish ONLY these, the year is a success
- Everything else bends around these
- Your CoS will relentlessly protect time for these

**Priority 2: Important But Flexible**
- 2-3 goals maximum
- Important, but can slow down if P1 needs focus
- Your CoS will push on these, but not at P1's expense

**Priority 3: Opportunistic**
- 2-3 goals maximum
- "Would be nice" goals
- Only pursue if P1 and P2 are on track
- Your CoS will remind you not to let these distract from P1/P2

**Why this structure?**
Most people treat everything as Priority 1, which means nothing is. This forces clarity.

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Priority 1 Goal(s)

**The Test:**
If you could ONLY accomplish 1-2 things in the next 90 days, what would create the most meaningful impact on your life?

Not what sounds impressive. Not what you "should" do. What actually matters?

**Examples of Good Priority 1 Goals:**
- "Launch my product and get 100 paying users"
- "Write and publish my book"
- "Lose 30 pounds and maintain for 90 days"
- "Get promoted to Senior Engineer"
- "Build financial runway to quit my job"

**Red Flags (These Are NOT Priority 1):**
- "Learn to code" (means what? for what purpose?)
- "Be more productive" (unmeasurable)
- "Read more books" (nice, but is this really THE most important?)
- "Get organized" (this is a means, not a goal)

**Sit with this:** What goal, if you accomplished it, would make everything else easier or unnecessary?

---

## Step 2: Make Goals Specific and Measurable

Vague goals are wishes. Specific goals are targets.

### The Formula

For each goal, answer:
1. **What specifically will you accomplish?**
2. **How will you measure it?**
3. **What does success look like?**
4. **What's the timeline?**

**Example - Vague → Specific:**

❌ **Vague:** "Get healthier"
✅ **Specific:** "Lose 25 pounds (from 185 to 160) by June 30"

❌ **Vague:** "Grow my business"
✅ **Specific:** "Reach $10K MRR (from $2K) by having 100 paying users"

❌ **Vague:** "Learn web development"
✅ **Specific:** "Build and launch a functional web app with user authentication and database by April 15"

### Success Criteria

For each goal, define what success looks like:

**Example for "Launch Product to 100 Users":**
```
Success Criteria:
- Product is live and accessible via URL
- 100 people have created accounts
- At least 50 are actively using (logged in within 7 days)
- Core feature set is working (users can complete primary workflow)
- I have a way to reach these users (email list or in-app messaging)
```

This gives your CoS clear criteria to track and hold you accountable to.

---

## Step 3: Document the WHY (Most Critical)

Here's the secret: **Your "why" is more important than your "what."**

When things get hard (and they will), your CoS will remind you WHY this matters.

### The Five Levels Deep Technique

For each goal, ask "Why does this matter?" Then ask why again. Keep going 5 levels.

**Example:**
- **Goal:** Launch product to 100 paying users
- **Why?** To validate the business idea
  - **Why does that matter?** To know if I should pursue this full-time
    - **Why does that matter?** To escape my soul-crushing corporate job
      - **Why does that matter?** Because I'm trading my life for a paycheck doing work I don't care about
        - **Why does that matter?** Because I don't want to reach 60 and realize I never bet on myself or built something meaningful

**That last level - that's the REAL why.**

That's what your CoS will use when you're tired, discouraged, or making excuses.

### Write Your Why

For each Priority 1 goal, write:
- The surface reason (level 1-2)
- The real reason (level 4-5)
- What happens if you DON'T achieve this
- What becomes possible if you DO achieve this

**Example:**
```
## Priority 1: Launch Product to 100 Paying Users by June 30

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Surface: I want to build a successful business.

Real: I've spent 8 years building other people's products. I'm good at this.
But I've never bet on myself. I tell myself I will, but I always find
excuses. I'm afraid of failure, but I'm more afraid of never trying.
If I don't do this now, I'll be having the same conversation with myself
in 5 years, except more bitter and with fewer options.

If I don't achieve this: I stay stuck in comfortable misery, forever
wondering "what if."

If I do achieve this: I prove to myself I can execute. Even if the business
fails later, I'll know I'm capable of finishing what I start. And maybe,
just maybe, it becomes the thing that changes my life.
```

**This is what your CoS will reference when you want to quit.**

---

## Step 4: Create Weekly Targets

Break each goal into weekly milestones.

**Why weekly?**
- 90-day goals feel distant
- Daily goals miss the bigger picture
- Weekly is the right cadence for tracking meaningful progress

**Example for "Launch Product to 100 Users by June 30":**
```
Week 1: Complete user research (10 interviews)
Week 2: Finalize feature set and wireframes
Week 3: Build MVP - core workflow
Week 4: Build MVP - user accounts
Week 5: Testing and bug fixes
Week 6: Soft launch to 10 beta users
Week 7: Iterate based on feedback
Week 8: Public launch
Week 9-12: Growth to 100 users (25/week)
```

Your CoS will use these to:
- Check if you're on track
- Adjust if you're falling behind
- Celebrate when you hit milestones
- Challenge when you're avoiding difficult weeks

---

## Step 5: Repeat for Priority 2 and 3 Goals

Follow the same process for P2 and P3 goals, but:

**Priority 2:**
- Can be slightly less detailed than P1
- Still need clear success criteria
- WHY is important but doesn't need to be as deep

**Priority 3:**
- Can be more flexible
- Success criteria still matter
- WHY can be simpler ("would be valuable if time allows")

**Remember:** If you're spending more time on P2/P3 than P1, something is wrong.

---

## Step 6: Create Your Goals Document

**6.1 Get the Template**

Open the template file:
- [Goals Document Template](templates/Goals_Document_Template.md)

**6.2 Fill It Out**

Create your document with:
```
# My Goals

## Priority 1: [Goal Name]
**Target:** [Specific, measurable outcome by date]
**Success Criteria:**
- [Specific criteria 1]
- [Specific criteria 2]

**Why This Matters:**
[Your deep why - be honest]

**Weekly Targets:**
Week 1: [Milestone]
Week 2: [Milestone]
...

---

## Priority 2: [Goal Name]
[Same structure]

---

## Priority 3: [Goal Name]
[Same structure]
```

**6.3 Save and Upload**

1. Save as `My_Goals.md` or `My_Goals.txt`
2. Go to your Personal CoS Project
3. Click "Knowledge"
4. Upload your Goals document
5. Verify it appears in Knowledge section

---

## Step 7: Test It

In your Project chat, ask:
```
What are my Priority 1 goals? Why do they matter to me?
```

Your CoS should be able to:
- List your goals accurately
- Explain WHY they matter (in your words)
- Reference your success criteria
- Know your weekly targets

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Many Priority 1 Goals:**
- ❌ 5 P1 goals = nothing is actually P1
- ✅ 1-2 P1 goals = real prioritization

**Vague Success Criteria:**
- ❌ "Make good progress on my book"
- ✅ "Complete first draft (50,000 words minimum) by May 15"

**Shallow Why:**
- ❌ "It would be good for my career"
- ✅ "I've been waiting for permission to lead. No one's giving it to me. This forces me to step up or admit I don't actually want it."

**Unrealistic Timelines:**
- ❌ "Launch Fortune 500 product in 2 weeks"
- ✅ "Launch MVP with core features in 6 weeks, iterate from there"

**Forgetting Weekly Targets:**
- Without these, your CoS can't track if you're on pace
- Weekly check-ins become vague instead of specific

---

## The Litmus Test

Before finalizing your goals, ask yourself:

**For Priority 1:**
- If I accomplish ONLY this goal, would I consider the next 90 days successful?
- Am I willing to sacrifice other things to make this happen?
- Is this MY goal, or someone else's expectation?

**For all goals:**
- Can I measure when I've succeeded?
- Do I know what I need to do this week to make progress?
- Have I been honest about why this matters?

If the answer to any of these is "no," revise before moving forward.

---

## What You've Accomplished

✅ Identified your true Priority 1 goal(s)
✅ Made goals specific and measurable
✅ Documented the deep WHY behind each goal
✅ Created weekly targets to track progress
✅ Uploaded Goals document to your CoS Project

**Your CoS now knows WHAT you're working toward and WHY it matters.**

---

## What's Next

You've taught your CoS about YOU (Module 2) and your GOALS (Module 3).

Next, you'll write the instructions that determine HOW your CoS interacts with you.

Continue to **Module 4: Write Instructions** to:
- Define how your CoS should behave
- Set the tone and interaction style
- Create the Custom Instructions for your Project
- Complete your CoS setup

[→ Go to Module 4: Write Instructions](04-write-instructions.md)

---

## Updating Goals Over Time

**Your goals will evolve. That's normal.**

When they do:
1. Edit your local Goals document
2. Re-upload to Project Knowledge
3. Tell your CoS: "My goals have changed. Please read the updated Goals document."

**When to update:**
- You accomplish a goal (celebrate, then set new one)
- Priorities shift due to life changes
- You realize a goal isn't actually important to you
- Weekly targets need adjustment based on reality

**Don't update because:**
- It's getting hard (that's when the WHY matters most)
- You're afraid you'll fail (CoS will help you figure out why)
- You want to avoid hard decisions (CoS should push you on this)

---

**Remember:** Your goals aren't what you think you "should" want. They're what you ACTUALLY want badly enough to sacrifice other things for.

If you're not willing to protect time for a goal, it's not actually a priority. Be honest with yourself and your CoS.
