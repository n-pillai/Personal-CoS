# Module 2: Know Yourself - Create Your User Profile

## What You'll Do
- Reflect on your work style and energy patterns
- Document your decision-making preferences
- Identify your constraints and what you need to track
- Create your User Profile for your CoS

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours, total. Don't rush this. 

It doesn't have to be done in one shot. You can optionally get to a first version by uploading the User_Profile template to Claude (or an LLM of your choice) and asking it to interview you step by step until the document is complete. For a streamlined experience, check out the [Chief of Staff Compiler](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-698385dfc500819182856fc4fb2ad658-chief-of-staff-compiler) CustomGPT created by [Anennya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anennya), which helps you build your User Profile through guided conversation. Be sure to iterate and update the document over time until you're happy with the way your Personal CoS understands and works with you. 

---

## Why This Matters

Your Personal CoS can only be effective if it understands YOU.

Generic productivity advice fails because it doesn't account for:
- How YOUR energy works throughout the day
- What motivates YOU specifically
- What constraints YOU operate under
- How YOU make decisions

**The better your CoS knows you, the better it can help you.**

---

## What is a User Profile?

Think of this as your CoS's onboarding document about you. Like when you hire someone and teach them:
- How you like to work
- What drains vs. energizes you
- How you make decisions
- What you need help with

This profile becomes a Knowledge document in your Claude Project, giving your CoS context about who you are.

---

## Step 1: Understand the Profile Structure

Your User Profile will cover:

1. **Work Style** - How you work best
2. **Energy Patterns** - When you're productive vs. depleted
3. **Decision Making** - How you evaluate choices
4. **Constraints** - Your real-world limitations
5. **Tracking Needs** - What you need accountability on
6. **Communication Preferences** - How you want your CoS to interact with you

---

## Step 2: Create Your Profile Document

**2.1 Get the Template**

Open the template file:
- [User Profile Template](templates/User_Profile_Template.md)

**2.2 Save Your Own Copy**

Create a new document (Google Docs, Notion, or any text editor):
- Title: "My User Profile"
- Copy the template structure
- You'll fill this out section by section

**Important:** This is PRIVATE. Only you and your Personal CoS will see it. Be brutally honest.

---

## Step 3: Fill Out Each Section

Work through these one at a time. Don't rush.

### 3.1 Work Style

**Questions to answer:**
- Are you a morning person or night owl?
- Do you work better in sprints or steady marathons?
- Do you prefer deep focus blocks or varied tasks?
- How do you handle interruptions?
- What environment helps you focus?

**Example:**
```
## Work Style
I'm most creative in the morning (6am-10am) but can't do admin work
until afternoon. I work best in 90-minute deep focus blocks with
breaks between. Open office destroys my productivity - I need quiet
or white noise. I'm terrible at estimating time and often over-commit.
```

**Why this helps your CoS:**
- It won't suggest morning admin tasks when you're in creative mode
- It will structure your day around deep focus blocks
- It will challenge you when you're over-committing

### 3.2 Energy Patterns

**Questions to answer:**
- What gives you energy vs. drains you?
- How does your energy fluctuate across a day? Week? Month?
- What are early warning signs you're burning out?
- What recharges you?

**Example:**
```
## Energy Patterns
I have high energy Monday-Wednesday, crash Thursday, recover Friday.
Meetings drain me - I need recovery time after.
Creative work energizes me; repetitive tasks drain me.
Warning signs I'm burning out: sleeping poorly, avoiding work, snapping at people.
What recharges me: exercise, time with friends, building things.
```

**Why this helps your CoS:**
- It will protect your high-energy time for important work
- It will notice when you're scheduling too many draining activities
- It will suggest recharge activities before you burn out

### 3.3 Decision Making

**Questions to answer:**
- Do you decide quickly or need time to process?
- Do you over-analyze decisions or act impulsively?
- What helps you make good decisions?
- What causes you to make bad decisions?
- How do you handle uncertainty?

**Example:**
```
## Decision Making
I over-analyze small decisions and under-think big ones (backwards!).
I make better decisions when I write out pros/cons.
I make terrible decisions when tired or hungry.
I need to verbally process with someone to clarify my thinking.
I avoid decisions when I'm uncertain, which makes things worse.
```

**Why this helps your CoS:**
- It will prompt you to write out pros/cons for decisions
- It will notice when you're avoiding an important decision
- It will ask clarifying questions to help you think through choices

### 3.4 Constraints

**Questions to answer:**
- What are your non-negotiable time commitments?
- What resources are limited? (time, money, energy, attention)
- What dependencies do you have? (family, job, health)
- What can you NOT change right now?

**Example:**
```
## Constraints
- Full-time job: 9am-5pm, not flexible
- Kids: pickup at 3pm daily, weekends are family time
- Budget: limited, can't hire help or buy time
- Health: chronic condition means I need 8hrs sleep minimum
- Location: remote area, can't easily attend in-person events
```

**Why this helps your CoS:**
- It won't suggest strategies that ignore your reality
- It will work within your actual constraints
- It will be realistic about what you can commit to

### 3.5 What You Need to Track

**Questions to answer:**
- What do you tend to forget or lose track of?
- What commitments do you make but not follow through on?
- What metrics matter for your goals?
- What patterns should your CoS watch for?

**Example:**
```
## What to Track
- Commitments I make (I often forget or de-prioritize)
- Time spent on Priority 1 goal (I say it's important but don't act like it)
- Exercise frequency (I skip when stressed, which makes stress worse)
- Decision deadlines (I let these slide)
- Warning signs of burnout (listed in Energy Patterns)
```

**Why this helps your CoS:**
- It will actively track what you need accountability on
- It will call you out when actions don't match stated priorities
- It will notice patterns before you do

### 3.6 Communication Preferences

**Questions to answer:**
- How direct do you want your CoS to be?
- Do you want tough questions or gentle nudges?
- What tone works best for you?
- How much detail do you want in responses?
- What frustrates you in interactions?

**Example:**
```
## Communication Preferences
Be direct, even blunt. I need someone to call out my BS.
Ask hard questions - that's what I hired a CoS for.
Don't sugarcoat. Don't let me off the hook.
Be concise - I hate fluff and "executive speak."
Push back when my actions don't match my goals.
Celebrate wins, but don't overdo it.
```

**Why this helps your CoS:**
- It will interact with you in the way that actually helps
- It won't waste your time with pleasantries if you don't want them
- It will hold you accountable in the way you respond to

---

## Step 4: Review for Honesty

This is the most important step.

**Read through your profile and ask:**
- Am I being honest, or writing what sounds good?
- Have I included the ugly truths?
- Would someone who knows me well agree with this?
- Am I leaving out inconvenient constraints?

**Red flags that you're not being honest:**
- Everything sounds positive
- No mention of bad habits or patterns
- Constraints seem reasonable and manageable
- You'd be comfortable showing this to your boss

**Good signs you're being honest:**
- Some of it is uncomfortable to admit
- You've documented your actual weak points
- The constraints feel frustratingly real
- You wouldn't want colleagues to see this

**Remember:** Your CoS can't help you if you're performing for it. This is private. Be real.

---

## Step 5: Upload to Your Claude Project

**5.1 Save as Plain Text**

Save your completed profile as:
- Filename: `User_Profile.md` or `User_Profile.txt`
- Format: Plain text or Markdown (no fancy formatting needed)

**5.2 Upload to Project Knowledge**

1. Go to your Personal CoS Project in Claude
2. Click "Knowledge" (top navigation)
3. Click "Add content" or drag-and-drop your file
4. Upload `User_Profile.md`
5. Verify it shows up in Knowledge section

**5.3 Test It**

In your Project chat, ask:
```
Can you see my User Profile? What stands out to you about how I work?
```

Claude should be able to reference your profile and pull out key points.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Vague:**
- ❌ "I work well in the morning"
- ✅ "I'm most creative 6-10am but terrible at admin work until 2pm"

**Too Positive:**
- ❌ "I'm motivated and driven"
- ✅ "I'm motivated by building but terrible at maintenance tasks"

**Ignoring Constraints:**
- ❌ Not mentioning your 2-hour commute
- ✅ "Commute kills 2hrs/day, drains energy for deep work"

**Generic Advice:**
- ❌ "I need work-life balance"
- ✅ "I work late into the night and skip exercise when stressed, which makes everything worse"

---

## What You've Accomplished

✅ Deep reflection on your actual work patterns
✅ Documented your real constraints and preferences
✅ Created an honest User Profile
✅ Uploaded to your Personal CoS Project

**Your CoS now knows WHO it's working with.**

---

## What's Next

You've taught your CoS about YOU. Next, you'll teach it about your GOALS.

Continue to **Module 3: Set Goals** to:
- Define what success looks like for you
- Create measurable targets
- Document WHY these goals matter
- Give your CoS a clear direction

[→ Go to Module 3: Set Goals](03-set-goals.md)

---

## Optional: Update Your Profile Over Time

Your User Profile isn't static. As you learn about yourself:

- Add new patterns you notice
- Update constraints as life changes
- Refine communication preferences
- Document what's working vs. not

**How to update:**
1. Edit your local User_Profile file
2. Re-upload to Project Knowledge (it will replace the old version)
3. Your CoS immediately has updated context

---

**Remember:** The quality of your Personal CoS depends on the quality of your self-knowledge. You've just done the hardest work - being honest with yourself about how you actually operate.

That honesty is what will make this system work.
