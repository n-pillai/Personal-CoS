## EXAMPLE: FILLED-IN GOALS

**CURRENT FOCUS PERIOD: Q4 2025 (Oct 1 - Dec 31)**

### PRIORITY 1: Launch New Product

**Target:** Ship MVP of [product name] and get 100 beta users by Dec 31

**Why this matters:** This is my path to leaving current job. Need working product before applying to new roles in January. Can't afford to wait another quarter.

**Success Criteria by Dec 31:**
- MVP deployed to production with core features working
- 100 beta users signed up and actively using
- 3+ pieces of feedback incorporated into v2 roadmap
- Landing page live with metrics tracking

**Key Blocker:** Tendency to over-engineer instead of shipping rough MVP. Need to embrace "good enough" and get real user feedback.

**Weekly Target:** 10-15 hours/week on product work

---

### PRIORITY 2: Build Professional Network in Industry

**Target:** Complete 12 substantive conversations with people in [industry] by Dec 31

**Why this matters:** Need strong network before job search begins Q1 2026. Currently have zero warm contacts in target companies.

**Success Criteria by Dec 31:**
- 12+ conversations completed (currently: 0)
- Pipeline of 20+ target contacts identified and researched
- 3+ follow-up meetings scheduled for January
- Consistent messaging/positioning tested and refined

**Key Blocker:** Defaulting to "helper mode" without making direct asks. Must practice requesting specific intros during conversations.

**Weekly Target:** 1 conversation/week + 2-3 hours research/outreach

---

### PRIORITY 3: Establish Thought Leadership Presence

**Target:** Build consistent public presence demonstrating expertise

**Why this matters:** Need to be discoverable when hiring managers search. Demonstrating expertise publicly opens doors that cold applications don't.

**Success Criteria by Dec 31:**
- Newsletter published every 2 weeks (6 editions total)
- LinkedIn posts 1x/week minimum
- Personal website live with portfolio projects
- At least 2 inbound inquiries from public content

**Key Blocker:** Perfectionism stopping publication. Need to publish rough drafts and iterate publicly.

**Weekly Target:** 3-5 hours on content creation

## NOTES

- Review this document at start of each week
- Update as you learn and circumstances change
- Celebrate wins, even small ones
- Adjust targets if they prove unrealistic - better honest than aspirational
- Remember: Progress over perfection

**The goal isn't to be superhuman. The goal is to make consistent progress on what matters most.**
