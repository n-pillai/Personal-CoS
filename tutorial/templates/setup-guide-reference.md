# Personal Chief of Staff System - Setup Guide

**For people who want to use this system with their own Claude Project**

Last updated: December 16, 2025

## WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

This is a complete personal productivity and accountability system that runs in a Claude Project. Think of it as your personal Chief of Staff who:

1. **Tracks your priorities ruthlessly** - Makes sure you're making progress on what matters most
2. **Manages daily planning** - Helps you organize each day around your goals
3. **Provides accountability** - Flags when you're avoiding important work
4. **Supports decision-making** - Shows you the math when trade-offs are needed
5. **Maintains your systems** - Updates tracking files, surfaces reminders, keeps you organized

**Key principle:** The system adapts to you, not the other way around. You define your goals, priorities, work style, and what you want to track.

## BEFORE YOU START

### You Need:
1. Access to Claude Projects (available in Claude Pro)
2. Time to document your goals and context (1-2 hours)
3. Willingness to maintain daily check-ins (at least initially)
4. Commitment to ruthless honesty about priorities

### This System Works Best If:
- You have clear goals but struggle with execution
- You tend to let urgent things crowd out important things
- You want accountability without hiring someone
- You're willing to be told when you're avoiding work
- You value having systems but don't want to spend energy maintaining them

### This Might Not Be For You If:
- You prefer to figure everything out yourself with no input
- You find accountability annoying rather than helpful
- You don't actually want to work on your stated priorities
- You're not willing to be honest about what you're doing
- You expect the system to do the work for you

## SETUP PROCESS

### STEP 1: Create Your Claude Project (15 minutes)

1. In Claude, create a new Project
2. Name it something like "Personal CoS" or "Leo" (or your preferred name)
3. Upload the **Project_Instructions_Generic.md** file as project knowledge
4. Upload the **Project_Instructions_Supplement.md** file as project knowledge

### STEP 2: Document Yourself (1-2 hours)

Fill out these templates (provided in the system):

**User_Profile_Template.md** - Your work style, constraints, preferences
- When are you most productive?
- What energizes/drains you?
- How do you make decisions?
- What are your life constraints?
- How should the system talk to you?

**Goals_Document_Template.md** - What you're working toward
- Your top 3 priorities
- Specific targets and timelines
- Why these matter
- Weekly targets to stay on track

**Be honest.** The system can only help if you're real about:
- What you actually want to accomplish
- What your real constraints are
- How you actually work (not how you wish you worked)

### STEP 3: Set Up Your File Structure (30 minutes)

Work with Claude to create:

**Current_Task_List.md**
- All your active tasks organized by goal area
- Deadlines and dependencies

**Reminders_Follow_Ups_Tracker.md**
- Daily, weekly, monthly reminders
- Conditional reminders (if X happens, do Y)
- Important dates

**Weekly_Completion_Log_[dates].md**
- Track what gets done each day
- Historical record for weekly reviews

**Additional tracking files based on your needs:**
- Contact/relationship tracking
- Reading lists
- Project-specific trackers
- Whatever helps you stay organized

### STEP 4: Start Using It (Ongoing)

**Week 1: Build the Habit**
- Daily check-ins (morning and end-of-day)
- First weekly review on Sunday
- Be patient - you're both learning the rhythm

**Week 2-4: Refine the System**
- Adjust file structures based on what works
- Modify check-in format if needed
- Add/remove tracking as you learn

**After Month 1: Maintain and Iterate**
- System should feel natural
- Keep refining based on what helps
- Drop what doesn't add value

## HOW TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY

### Daily Check-ins

**Morning:**
1. Start conversation: "Morning check-in"
2. System asks about current time (confirm)
3. Reviews reminders and calendar
4. Presents your day organized by time blocks
5. Asks about priorities
6. Surfaces goal progress status
7. You make decisions and work your day

**End of day:**
1. Start conversation: "End of day"
2. System presents what got done
3. You confirm/add anything missed
4. System generates updated files
5. You download and review
6. Takes ~5 minutes total

### Weekly Reviews (Sunday)

1. Start conversation: "Weekly review"
2. System presents Priority 1 goal progress (FIRST)
3. Shows brutal math: hours needed vs. hours worked
4. Forces decision if behind
5. Analyzes next week's capacity
6. Reviews other areas (goals, wellness, relationships)
7. Creates next week's plan
8. You update project files with new plan

### Monthly Check-ins

1. System presents goals dashboard
2. Shows if you're on track for targets
3. Flags if emergency mode needed
4. Reviews rest and recovery patterns
5. Identifies any concerning trends

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Priority 1 Gets Protected Ruthlessly

If you say something is Priority 1, the system will:
- Track hours spent on it weekly
- Flag when it's being neglected
- Force explicit decisions when conflicts arise
- Show you the math when you're falling behind
- Declare emergency mode if you're way behind

**This is the point.** If you don't want accountability on a goal, don't make it Priority 1.

### 2. Rest and Recovery Matter

The system tracks both work and rest because:
- Burnout kills productivity
- Pleasure is strategic
- Recovery enables performance
- Sustainable pace beats heroic sprints

You can customize how much rest tracking you want.

### 3. One Question at a Time

The system will STOP and WAIT after asking questions. This is intentional:
- Prevents overwhelming conversation flow
- Gives you space to think
- Respects that you're processing information
- Makes conversations feel more human

### 4. Brutal Honesty Over Comfort

The system will:
- Show you when you're avoiding work
- Point out patterns you might not see
- Calculate the math on your pace vs. goals
- Force explicit decisions on trade-offs

This only works if you're honest about:
- What you're actually doing
- Why you're avoiding things
- What's really blocking you

### 5. Adapt, Don't Force

If something isn't working:
- Change it
- Tell the system what to adjust
- Try different approaches
- Drop what doesn't help

The goal is a system that serves you, not one you serve.

## COMMON QUESTIONS

### "How much time does this take?"

**Daily:** ~10 minutes total (5 min morning, 5 min evening)
**Weekly:** ~30-45 minutes for Sunday review
**Monthly:** ~15 minutes additional for dashboard check

So about 1.5-2 hours per week maintaining the system.

### "What if I miss days?"

Just pick back up. The system doesn't judge. But it will point out patterns if you're consistently avoiding check-ins.

### "Can I modify the instructions?"

Yes! That's the point. Start with the template, then adjust:
- Add sections relevant to you
- Remove what doesn't help
- Change language/tone
- Modify file structures
- Whatever makes it work better

### "What if my goals change?"

Update your goals document and tell the system. It will adapt. Goals should evolve as you learn.

### "This feels like a lot of structure. Is that necessary?"

Try it for 4 weeks, then adjust. Some people need more structure, others less. The system should feel supportive, not suffocating.

If it feels oppressive, you're probably either:
- Tracking too many things (drop some)
- Being too rigid (add flexibility)
- Not being honest about your goals (update them)

### "What if I want less accountability?"

Tell the system to ease up in certain areas. You control the level of push.

But consider: If you don't want accountability, why set up this system at all? There's no shame in deciding you don't need it.

### "Can this replace a therapist/coach/manager?"

**No.** This is a productivity and accountability system, not:
- Mental health support
- Professional coaching
- Management oversight
- Relationship counseling

It complements these things but doesn't replace them.

## MAKING IT YOUR OWN

### Customize the Name
- Call your assistant whatever you want
- "Leo" is optional (from The West Wing reference)
- Make it personal if that helps

### Adjust the Tone
- Want more direct? Tell the system
- Prefer gentler? Adjust instructions
- Need different communication style? Modify

### Focus on What Matters to You
- Don't track things that don't help
- Add domain-specific tracking you need
- Ignore suggested sections that aren't relevant

### Build Trust Over Time
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Prove the basics work before expanding
- Let the relationship develop naturally

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "The system is too pushy"
Adjust accountability levels in instructions. Tell it to ease up on certain goals.

### "I'm not making progress on my goals"
This is what the system is designed to surface. Options:
1. Your goals aren't actually your priorities (update them)
2. You're avoiding something (figure out what and why)
3. Your capacity assumptions are wrong (adjust weekly targets)
4. You need to cut other commitments (make the trade-off explicit)

### "The files are overwhelming"
- Reduce number of files
- Simplify tracking
- Focus on essentials only

### "Check-ins feel like busywork"
- Streamline the process
- Focus on Priority 1 only for a while
- Drop optional tracking
- Make sure check-ins are actually helping

### "I can't maintain daily check-ins"
Try:
- 3x/week instead of daily
- Just weekly reviews for a while
- Morning only (skip end-of-day)
- Find rhythm that's sustainable

**Better to maintain something simple than abandon something perfect.**

## SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

After 1 month, you should:
- Have a clear view of your priorities
- Know if you're making progress toward goals
- Catch yourself avoiding important work sooner
- Have better data for planning time
- Feel more in control of your days

After 3 months, you should:
- Have made measurable progress on Priority 1
- Have established sustainable rhythms
- Trust the system to catch what you miss
- Spend less mental energy on organization
- Have clearer sense of your patterns

After 6 months, you should:
- Have completed significant goals
- Have a system that feels natural
- Rarely let Priority 1 slip for more than a few days
- Make better trade-off decisions
- Have historical data showing your progress

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

This system works because it:
1. Forces you to name your priorities
2. Tracks if your actions match your priorities
3. Surfaces the gaps honestly
4. Gives you choice about what to do
5. Builds historical data over time

It can't:
- Do the work for you
- Make you want different things
- Change your circumstances
- Force you to be someone you're not

**What it CAN do is make sure that when you say something matters, you're actually spending time on it.**

If you're tired of letting important things slip while urgent things take over, this system can help.

If you're ready to be ruthlessly honest about what you're doing and why, this system can help.

If you want an accountability partner who doesn't judge but won't let you off the hook, this system can help.

The question is: Do you actually want to make progress on your stated priorities?

If yes, set it up and give it 4 weeks.

If no, that's fine too. But be honest about it.
