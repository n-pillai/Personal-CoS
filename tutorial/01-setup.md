# Module 1: Setup - Get Claude Pro & Create Your Project

## What You'll Do
- Get Claude Pro subscription
- Create your first Claude Project
- Understand how Projects work
- Set up your CoS workspace

**Time Required:** 15 minutes

---

## Step 1: Get Claude Pro

Your Personal CoS runs on Claude Projects, which requires Claude Pro.

**Why Claude Pro?**
- Projects feature (critical for this system)
- Higher usage limits for daily check-ins
- Cost: $20/month

**How to Subscribe:**

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Sign up or log in with your account
3. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
4. Complete payment ($20/month)
5. Verify you see "Pro" badge in your account

**Note:** You'll need Pro to complete this tutorial (Projects are Pro-only).

---

## Step 2: Understand Claude Projects

**What is a Claude Project?**

A Project is like giving Claude a dedicated workspace with:
- **Custom Instructions** - How Claude should behave in this Project
- **Knowledge Base** - Documents Claude can reference (your profile, goals, etc.)
- **Conversation History** - All your chats are kept in one place
- **Context Persistence** - Claude remembers across conversations

**Why Projects are Perfect for Personal CoS:**

Claude chat:
- ❌ Forgets context between conversations
- ❌ No access to your personal documents
- ❌ Generic responses
- ❌ You repeat yourself constantly

Claude Project as Personal CoS:
- ✅ Remembers your goals, constraints, and commitments
- ✅ References your profile and goals automatically
- ✅ Personalized to your specific situation
- ✅ Continuity across all check-ins

---

## Step 3: Create Your Personal CoS Project

**3.1 Create the Project**

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Click "Projects" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create Project"
4. Name it: **"Personal Chief of Staff"** (or whatever you prefer)
5. Click "Create"

**3.2 Understand the Project Interface**

You'll see three sections:

1. **Chat** - Where you'll have conversations with your CoS
2. **Custom Instructions** - Where you'll add Project Instructions (Module 4)
3. **Knowledge** - Where you'll upload your Profile and Goals (Modules 2 & 3)

Don't add anything yet - we'll build these step by step in the next modules.

---

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

Let's verify everything works:

**4.1 Send a Test Message**

In your new Project, type:
```
Hi! I'm setting up my Personal Chief of Staff system. Can you confirm you're in a Claude Project?
```

**Expected Response:**
Claude should confirm it's in a Project and can access Custom Instructions and Knowledge files (though none are added yet).

**4.2 Verify Projects Feature**

In the left sidebar, you should see:
- ✅ Your new "Personal Chief of Staff" project listed
- ✅ Ability to create more projects
- ✅ Chat interface within the project

If you don't see this, verify your Claude Pro subscription is active.

---

## Step 5: Organize Your Workspace

You'll be using this daily, so set up for easy access:

**Browser Bookmark (Recommended):**
1. Open your Personal CoS Project
2. Bookmark the page (Cmd+D / Ctrl+D)
3. Name it "CoS Check-in" or similar
4. Add to your bookmarks bar for one-click access

**Desktop Shortcut (Optional):**
- Mac: Drag bookmark to desktop
- Windows: Right-click bookmark → Create shortcut

**Mobile Access:**
- Download Claude mobile app
- Log in with same account
- Your Projects sync across devices

---
## Understanding Costs

**What you'll pay:**

- **Claude Pro:** $20/month (required)
- **That's it.** No additional costs.

**Usage within Pro:**

Your daily check-ins will use Claude messages. With Pro:
- You get significantly higher message limits
- Typical usage: 1-2 check-ins/day = well within limits
- No per-message charges

**Worth it?**

Ask yourself: What's the cost of NOT executing on your important goals?

- Delayed projects = opportunity cost
- Unfulfilled potential = career impact
- Lack of clarity = wasted time

If $20/month helps you execute better, it's likely the highest ROI subscription you'll have.

## Common Setup Issues

**"I don't see Projects in my sidebar"**
- Verify Claude Pro is active (check for Pro badge)
- Refresh the page
- Try logging out and back in
- Contact Claude support if still missing

**"Can I use free Claude?"**
- No, Projects require Claude Pro
- You can try free Claude to test it out
- But you'll need Pro to complete this tutorial

**"Is this safe? What data does Claude see?"**
- You control what you upload to your Project
- Data is processed by Anthropic (Claude's maker)
- Review Anthropic's privacy policy at anthropic.com
- Don't upload anything you wouldn't share with a human coach

**"Can I have multiple Projects?"**
- Yes! Pro allows multiple Projects
- Your Personal CoS will be one dedicated Project
- You can have others for work, creative projects, etc.

## What You've Accomplished

✅ Claude Pro subscription active
✅ Personal CoS Project created
✅ Understanding of how Projects work
✅ Workspace organized for daily access

---

## What's Next

Your Project is ready, but it's empty. Like hiring a Chief of Staff who knows nothing about you.

The next modules will teach your CoS about:
- **Module 2:** Who you are (your profile)
- **Module 3:** What you want (your goals)
- **Module 4:** How to interact with you (instructions)

Then you'll learn to use it effectively in daily practice.

---

## Before You Continue

**Take a breath.** You've committed to building something meaningful.

The next steps require deeper reflection. Block out time when you can think clearly:

- **Module 2 (Know Yourself):** 1-2 hours - requires honest self-reflection
- **Module 3 (Set Goals):** 1-2 hours - requires clarity on what matters

Don't rush these. The quality of your Personal CoS depends on the quality of your inputs.

---

## Next Steps

Continue to **Module 2: Know Yourself** to:
- Reflect on your work style and patterns
- Document your constraints and preferences
- Create your User Profile
- Give your CoS deep context about you

[→ Go to Module 2: Know Yourself](02-know-yourself.md)

---

**Remember:** You're building a thinking partner that will know you better than any productivity tool ever has. The setup time you invest now pays dividends daily.
