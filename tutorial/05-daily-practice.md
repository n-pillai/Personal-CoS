# Module 5: Daily Practice - Using Your Chief of Staff

## What You'll Learn
- How to structure daily check-ins
- What to share with your CoS
- How to get the most value from conversations
- Example check-in dialogues
- Building the daily habit

**Time Required:** 30 minutes to learn, 10-15 min/day ongoing

---

## Why Daily Practice Matters

You've built an incredible system:
- ✅ Your CoS knows who you are (Profile)
- ✅ Your CoS knows what you want (Goals)
- ✅ Your CoS knows how to help you (Instructions)

**But if you don't use it daily, it's just well-organized documents.**

The power comes from CONSISTENT check-ins where your CoS:
- Tracks your progress
- Notices patterns
- Challenges your thinking
- Keeps you accountable

---

## The Daily Check-In Structure

A good check-in covers:

1. **What you did yesterday** (toward P1 goal)
2. **What you're doing today** (specific actions)
3. **What's blocking you** (real obstacles)
4. **Decision/thinking you need help with**

**Time:** 10-15 minutes
**When:** Same time daily (consistency matters)

---

## When to Do Check-Ins

**Choose based on YOUR work style** (reference your Profile):

**Morning Check-Ins (Best for Most People):**
- Sets intention for the day
- Catches misalignment before you waste time
- CoS helps prioritize your day
- **Best if:** You want strategic direction before diving in

**End-of-Day Check-Ins:**
- Reflects on what happened
- Plans for tomorrow
- Processes decisions and learning
- **Best if:** You want to decompress and prepare for next day

**Both (Overachievers):**
- Morning: Set intention
- Evening: Reflect and adjust
- **Best if:** You want maximum accountability

**Start with ONE check-in per day.** Build the habit before adding more.

## What a Check-In Looks Like

### Example 1: Morning Check-In (Direct Style)

**You:**
```
Morning check-in. Yesterday I worked on the product landing page copy
and had two customer interviews. Today I'm planning to finish the landing
page and start on the signup flow. Feeling stuck on how to handle user
authentication - not sure if I should build it myself or use a service.
```

**Your CoS:**
```
Good progress on landing page and interviews. Those interviews are direct
P1 work - learning from potential users.

But let's address the authentication question:
1. How does building auth yourself serve your P1 goal of getting to 100 users by June 30?
2. What's your timeline? You're in Week 3, landing page + signup should be done by end of this week per your targets.
3. What would you choose if you had to decide right now?

Be honest: Is this a real decision, or are you procrastinating on the
harder parts of signup flow?
```

**What's happening here:**
- CoS acknowledged progress
- Connected activities to P1 goal
- Asked strategic questions
- Referenced weekly targets
- Challenged potential procrastination

### Example 2: Evening Check-In (Supportive Style)

**You:**
```
End of day check-in. I spent 4 hours in meetings today and only got
1 hour of actual work done on my P1. Feeling frustrated and behind.
```

**Your CoS:**
```
I hear your frustration. Let's look at this objectively:

From your Profile, meetings drain your energy significantly. You had 4 hours
of them today - that's rough.

Questions:
1. Were these meetings essential, or could some have been emails/async?
2. What specifically did you accomplish in that 1 hour of P1 work?
3. What can you do differently tomorrow to protect your focus time?

You're in Week 5, targeting MVP completion. One low-productivity day doesn't
derail you, but a pattern would. What would help you get back on track
tomorrow?
```

**What's happening here:**
- CoS validated feelings
- Referenced Profile context (meetings drain energy)
- Asked reflective questions
- Put one bad day in perspective
- Focused on forward action

### Example 3: When You're Avoiding Something

**You:**
```
I spent today researching design systems and reading articles about
best practices. Didn't actually code anything on the MVP.
```

**Your CoS:**
```
Let's be direct: How does reading about design systems serve your P1 goal
of launching to 100 users by June 30?

You're in Week 4. Per your targets, you should be building MVP - user
accounts this week. You're not doing that.

Questions:
1. What are you avoiding by researching instead of building?
2. Is this perfectionism? Fear of building wrong thing? Uncertainty?
3. What's the smallest thing you could BUILD (not read about) tomorrow?

Your P1 goal is not "learn best practices" - it's "get 100 paying users."
Users don't care if you followed design system best practices. They care
if your product solves their problem.

What are you going to build tomorrow?
```

**What's happening here:**
- CoS called out the avoidance
- Referenced goals and timeline
- Asked about real blockers
- Refocused on what actually matters
- Pushed toward action

---

## What to Share in Check-Ins

**DO share:**
- Specific work you did (or didn't do) on P1 goals
- Real blockers and decisions you're facing
- When you're struggling, avoiding, or feeling stuck
- Questions about strategy and approach
- Pattern you're noticing in yourself

**DON'T share:**
- Vague updates ("made some progress")
- Only successes (CoS needs full picture)
- Things that don't relate to your goals
- Excuses without reflection

**Your CoS is only as good as the information you give it.**

---

## How to Get Maximum Value

### 1. Be Honest About What You Actually Did

❌ **Performative:**
"I had a really productive day working on my business."

✅ **Honest:**
"I spent 3 hours on my business, but 2 of it was organizing files and
cleaning up my workspace. Only 1 hour was actual P1 work."

**Why honesty matters:**
- Your CoS can't help if you're performing
- Patterns only emerge if you're truthful
- You're not impressing anyone - this is private

### 2. Ask for What You Actually Need

❌ **Vague:**
"What should I work on?"

✅ **Specific:**
"I have 3 hours tomorrow morning. Should I finish the landing page or move
to signup flow? Landing page isn't perfect but it's functional."

**Your CoS can give better guidance with specifics.**

### 3. Push Back When CoS Isn't Helpful

If your CoS gives generic advice or misses the point:

**You:**
"That's not helpful. I know I should 'focus on P1' - I need help deciding
WHICH part of P1 to focus on right now given my energy and time constraints."

**Your CoS will recalibrate.**

### 4. Let Your CoS Challenge You

When your CoS asks hard questions, don't dodge:

❌ **Dodge:**
"Yeah, you're right, I'll do better tomorrow."

✅ **Engage:**
"Honestly? I'm procrastinating because I'm not sure if anyone will actually
want this product. What if I build it and no one cares?"

**That's the real conversation. That's where your CoS can help.**

### 5. Reference Past Conversations

**You:**
"Last week you asked if I was avoiding the marketing side. You were right.
I still haven't written that email to potential users. I think I'm afraid
of rejection."

**Your CoS has conversation history.** Use it to track themes and patterns.

---

## Building the Daily Habit

**Week 1: Commit to Daily Check-Ins**
- Same time every day
- Set a calendar reminder
- Even if it's just 5 minutes
- Consistency > perfection

**Week 2-4: Deepen the Practice**
- Share more honestly
- Ask harder questions
- Let CoS push you more
- Notice what's working

**Week 5+: Refine and Optimize**
- Adjust Custom Instructions if needed
- Update Profile as you learn about yourself
- Revise Goals if priorities shift
- Find your rhythm

---

## Example Week of Check-Ins

**Monday Morning:**
"Week 6 starting. Target this week: Soft launch to 10 beta users. I have
their emails. Today I'm finalizing the beta invite email. Nervous about
hitting send."

**Tuesday Morning:**
"Sent beta invites yesterday - 8 out of 10 already signed up! Today I'm
setting up analytics so I can see what they're doing in the app."

**Wednesday Evening:**
"Rough day. Got bug reports from 3 beta users. Spent all day firefighting
instead of building. Feeling like I launched too early."

**Thursday Morning:**
"Still feeling discouraged. Should I keep fixing bugs or move forward with
more features?"

**Friday End of Week:**
"Okay, I fixed the critical bugs. 7 out of 8 beta users are still active.
Got valuable feedback. Week 7 starts Monday - time to iterate based on
their feedback. Feeling better."

**See the pattern?**
- Honest about feelings and setbacks
- CoS can track the emotional arc
- Can reference "remember Thursday when you doubted? Look at Friday's progress"

---

## When to Adjust Your Approach

**If check-ins feel like a chore:**
- Your CoS might be too soft (not adding value)
- Or too harsh (feels punishing)
- Adjust Custom Instructions

**If you're not making progress on P1:**
- Your CoS should be calling this out
- If it's not, Instructions need strengthening
- If it is and you're ignoring it, that's a different problem

**If you keep skipping check-ins:**
- Wrong time of day for your energy
- Missing the "why" (re-read your Goals WHY section)
- Not seeing value yet (give it 2 full weeks)

---

## Common Pitfalls

**"I've been too busy for check-ins"**

Your CoS would ask: Too busy doing what? If you're too busy for a 10-minute
check-in, you're definitely too busy to be strategic about your time.

**"I don't have anything to report"**

That IS something to report. Your CoS should ask: "You've had 24 hours since
last check-in. What did you do instead of P1 work?"

**"I don't want to admit I didn't make progress"**

This is exactly what to share. Your CoS can help you figure out why and
what to do about it.

**"The check-ins feel repetitive"**

If you're doing the same thing every day with no progress, GOOD - your CoS
should make this uncomfortable. That's the point.

---

## What Success Looks Like

**Week 1:**
Check-ins feel awkward but you're building the habit.

**Week 2:**
You're being more honest. CoS is asking better questions.

**Week 3:**
Your CoS caught you procrastinating and you course-corrected.

**Week 4:**
You're making measurable progress on P1. You FEEL the difference.

**Week 8:**
Your CoS knows you so well, it asks questions you didn't know you needed.

**Week 12:**
You can't imagine working without this. It's changed how you execute.

## Your First Check-In

**After you finish this module, do your first check-in:**

Go to your Personal CoS Project and say:
```
This is my first check-in. I've just completed the setup (Profile, Goals,
Instructions). Based on my P1 goal, what should I focus on this week?
What questions do you have for me to get started?
```

**Let your CoS take it from there.**

**💡 Tip:** Bookmark the [Quick Reference Guide](QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for visual flowcharts and quick prompts you can use during check-ins.

Welcome to a new way of working.

**Remember:** The power isn't in having a sophisticated system. It's in using it honestly, daily, and letting it keep you focused on what actually matters.

You've built the system. Now build the habit.
